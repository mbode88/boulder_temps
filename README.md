Study of temperature divergence in Boulder, CO

This is an exercise in data anlysis and linear regression to better understand how average annual temperature divergence behavior changes over time. 

data/ contains data pulled from NOAA on monthly high and low temperatures, as well as average precipitation. The final plot is also saved in this folder as a .png file.

The analysis script, divergence.py, is an exercise in handling messy data and how to fill in missing data to make the set complete, as well as plotting with matplotlib and some light statistical analysis.

Conclusively, the results show a clear trend in temperature divergence over time with the average annual high temperature increasing and the average annual low temperature decreasing. There is no attempt to discern the underlying cause for this temperature divergence, though global warming seems a likely culprit.
